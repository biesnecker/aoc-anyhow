Getting Advent of Code puzzles done any way I can (mostly Python). I'm not always _proud_ of these solutions, but they get the job done.

Not every year is here. I did [a couple of years in C](https://github.com/biesnecker/advent_c) and [some others in Go](https://github.com/biesnecker/godvent) and some others in one-off scripts that I've lost.

Inputs not included, [per the copyright / request from the creator](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/). All of the scripts are written to assume that the input is in the root directory along with the script, and that it's named `YYYYDD.txt`.

Hit [me up on Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@papajohn) if you want to chat about any of these.
